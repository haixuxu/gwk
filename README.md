# gank

Gank is a tool that helps you expose your local servers or services to the internet, even in a private network. It supports both TCP and subdomain modes.

In TCP mode, Gank creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the Gank server, allowing external access to your locally hosted services by forwarding incoming traffic from a specific port on the Gank server to a designated port on your local machine.

In subdomain mode, Gank allows you to assign custom subdomains to your local services. This means you can access your services using easy-to-remember URLs like `service.example.com` instead of using IP addresses and port numbers.

Overall, Gank simplifies the process of exposing your local services to the internet, making it easier to showcase your projects or collaborate with others remotely.
